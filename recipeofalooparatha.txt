Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here is a recipe for aloo paratha, a delicious Indian flatbread stuffed with spiced potatoes.

Ingredients:

* 2 cups whole wheat flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 tbsp oil
* 1 cup lukewarm water
* 4 medium-sized potatoes, boiled and mashed
* 1 tsp cumin seeds
* 1 tsp coriander powder
* 1 tsp garam masala
* 1 tsp red chili powder
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
* 2 tbsp oil or ghee, for cooking

Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, salt, and 2 tbsp oil. Gradually add the lukewarm water while mixing the dough until it comes together. Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes until it is smooth and pliable. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.
2. In a separate bowl, mix together the mashed potatoes, cumin seeds, coriander powder, garam masala, red chili powder, chopped cilantro, and salt to taste.
3. Divide the dough into 8-10 equal-sized balls. Roll out each ball into a circle about 4-5 inches in diameter.
4. Place a few tablespoons of the potato filling in the center of each circle. Fold the edges of the dough over the filling and press down to seal it.
5. Roll out the stuffed dough ball into a paratha about 6-7 inches in diameter, using a little flour to prevent sticking.
6. Heat a tawa or non-stick pan over medium heat. Place the paratha on the pan and cook until it starts to brown on one side. Flip it over and cook on the other side until it is golden brown and cooked through.
7. Brush the paratha with oil or ghee and serve it hot with yogurt or pickle.
